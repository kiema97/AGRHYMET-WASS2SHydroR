\title{Check availability of suggested packages (internal)}
\usage{
engine_is_available(
  pkg,
  feature = NULL,
  strict = FALSE,
  version = NULL,
  attach = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{Character vector. Name(s) of the package(s) to check.}

\item{feature}{Optional character. Description of the feature or functionality
that depends on these packages (used only in messages).}

\item{strict}{Logical. If `TRUE`, the function raises an error when any
required package is missing. If `FALSE` (default), returns `FALSE` and
emits an informative message for missing packages.}

\item{version}{Optional character vector. Minimum required version for
each package. Recycled if length 1.}

\item{attach}{Logical. If `TRUE`, attempts to attach the package to the
search path when available. Defaults to `FALSE`.}
}
\value{
Logical (`TRUE` if all packages are available and meet version
  requirements, `FALSE` otherwise). In `strict = TRUE` mode, an error
  is thrown instead of returning `FALSE`.
}
\description{
This helper function verifies whether suggested packages are installed,
without forcing hard dependencies. It is mainly used to enable or skip
certain features in package workflows depending on whether optional
backend packages are available.
}
\details{
This function is intended for internal use to manage "soft dependencies"
declared in the `Suggests` field. It provides flexible checking for
multiple packages with optional version requirements and attachment.

When `attach = TRUE`, the function will attempt to load the package
using `library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)` for each available package.
This can be useful when you need the package attached for its functionality.
