\usage{
wass2s_hype_run(
  run_dir,
  exe_path = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{run_dir}{Directory containing HYPE inputs (info.txt, GeoData.txt, etc.).}

\item{exe_path}{Optional explicit path to the HYPE executable. If NULL, the function
searches for exactly one `.exe` directly inside `run_dir`.}

\item{args}{Character vector of command-line arguments passed to HYPE (if supported).}

\item{env}{Named character vector of environment variables to set during the run.}

\item{timeout_sec}{Maximum time to wait in seconds (0 = no timeout).}

\item{expected_files}{Character vector of output file paths (relative to `run_dir`)
that must exist after a successful run.}

\item{clean_regex}{Character vector of REGEX patterns used to delete files under
`run_dir` before running (e.g., `c("^hyss_.*\\\\.log$", "results/.*\\\\.txt$")`).}

\item{log_prefix}{Prefix for stdout/stderr log files. Defaults to a timestamp tag.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
  \item success (logical)
  \item exit_status (integer)
  \item duration_sec (double)
  \item run_dir (character)
  \item stdout_log (character)
  \item stderr_log (character)
  \item outputs (tibble)
}
}
\description{
This function runs the HYPE executable from `run_dir` and captures stdout/stderr
into log files. Optionally, it deletes old outputs before running and validates
that expected outputs exist after the run.
